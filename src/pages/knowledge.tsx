              <h1>Coding Knowledge</h1>
              <h3>I know C++, Unity C#, Python, HTML/CSS/ReactJS</h3>
              <h5>All Self Taught</h5>
              <br/>
              <h1>C++</h1>
              <p>I learned C++ to use SDL2 and OpenGL to make games/engines.
                <br />
                I started learning C++ in 2022 around the start of the year with
                SDL2 tutorials by LazyFoo, setting out to make a game engine, even with
                my little knowledge
                <br />
                Even though my efforts were fruitless it taught me many things
                  about the C++ language that I use today.
                <br />
                I still am attempted to make a game engine, just not using SDL2 this
                time. I am going to use OpenGL as to have more control over my engine
              </p>
    
              <br/>
              <h1>Unity C#</h1>
              <p>I learned C# in the Unity context to make games with my friends
                and to make games for competitions
                <br />
                I started learning Unity C# in 2017 for the purpose of a club I was
                in, TSA. There was a game making competition and I wanted to enter.
                I joined and started to learn Unity C#.
                <br />
                There is still a video of my first game I made out on Youtube.

                <br />
                It was not good but it was the start that led to where I am now, 5
                years later
              </p>
              <br />
              <h1>Python</h1>
              <p>I started learning Python in 2020 because I was bored and wanted
                to learn how to code. I heard that Python and Lua were both easy
                starter languages but I wasnt sure which one to pick. After some
                more research I decided to go with Python because it had more support
                and more features I wanted.
                <br />
                I have put some of my recent Python projects on Github. If you would
                like to see, just click on the Github logo at the bottom of this
                page.
              </p>
              <br />
              <h1>HTML/CSS/ReactJS</h1>
              <p>I started learning HTML/CSS/JS around 8 years ago since it was
                the most simple languages to pickup and start coding with. I didnt
                know about compilers or anything with Command Prompt so I stuck
                with this just for the fact that I could edit the HTML file and immediately
                see results.
                <br />
                <p>I got the foundations of HTML and CSS down but I didnt know much
                  about Javascript. I didnt like the Syntax compared to HTML, it was
                  too confusing. I did eventually get around to learning Javascript
                  and got the hang of it. I wanted more though and wanted to learn more.
                  I heard about Javascript frameworks from Youtube videos but never
                  thought about trying one. I found a popular framework known as
                  React, the framework used to build this website, and I was set on learning it.
                  I did get React down and I know the basics of React but I could
                  definately learn more. React is the most recent coding thing I have 
                  pursued to learn more about.
