<center><p id="patchNotes">Over the past 2 weeks I have been hard at work trying to make the emulator more enjoyable for everyone and functional for everyone. I have run into some roadblocks although such as wifi blocking my CDN website. Thats why I have completely overhauled how I store my games! I store them on the same website as the emulators. This increases the risk of the site getting banned but it also makes it miles easier to add more games and unblocks said games. If this site is blocked I will be changing domains and if I hear of blockages happening I will post the new domain here. Keep on Gaming!</p></center>
