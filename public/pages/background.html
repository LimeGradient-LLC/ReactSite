              I've been in love with programming for a long time, mainly due to my cousin doing web programming and me wanting to follow in his footsteps.
              I started programming around 7 years old with very basic HTML and CSS. I was also (and am still) very into video games which showed in my programming.
              I made fan websites about games that I liked and used sites like W3Schools to help further my learning.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3 h5 text-muted">
              When I was 12 years old I wanted to move away from the front end portion of coding and delve into more complex languages.
              I heard Python was a pretty easy language to learn so I went at it, making a bunch of little project while learning more about Python.
              I then moved onto more "challenging" languages like nodejs and a little bit of C++, but I stopped with C++ shortly after starting to learn it because of how hard it was.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3 h5 text-muted">
              Also around that time is when I wanted to start learning how to make games. I picked up the Unity Engine around 2017 and started to learn how to make games.
              The engine and all of its features were daunting so after a few months I put down the engine for 2 years. Around Mid 2019 I picked Unity back up and really started to learn.
              There is also a video of one of my first Unity games, which you can view <a href="../videos/unity_game.mp4">here</a>
